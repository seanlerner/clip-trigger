# Clip Trigger

Clip Trigger is a background application that monitors clipboard activity. When it sees a predefined trigger copied to the clipboard, it executes a process.

## Getting Started

1. [Download Clip Trigger](https://github.com/seanlerner/clip-trigger-disttribution/blob/master/README.md)
2. Install and open Clip Trigger
3. Open the menu from the Clip Trigger icon (in your system tray)
4. Select Triggers
5. Click `Install` for any triggers you'd like to use

## Using

Copy the two letter shortcode (plus possibly any further details the trigger may require) to your clipboard. See individual triggers for more information on how to use them.

## Creating Triggers

Clip Trigger has been designed to allow you to create your own triggers.

Install existing triggers for examples on how to create triggers.

Your triggers will be installed to:

`~/Library/Application Support/ClipTrigger/triggers`

Place any triggers you create in the same directory.

If you'd like to share your trigger with the world, add it to the [Clip Trigger Directory](https://github.com/seanlerner/clip-trigger-directory).
